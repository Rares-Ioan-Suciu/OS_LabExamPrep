# README

The problems from the problem set are all the problems given as homework or that we marked as so in the Ciprian Pungila website thingy.  

The PDF named **Problem Set** at one point becomes inaccurate, but each problem has its prompt as a big comment at the start.  

The rest of the files are from the **exam from last year**, the ones that start with `Exi`, where `i` ranges from 1 to 11.  
Most of these are problems of: Describing what the code does and what the problems are, then rewriting.  

Additionally, the file **lab_shit** contains some notions, more or less needed, to understand what the lab is.  

Anyways, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kg9xRooTVk).
